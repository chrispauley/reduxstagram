# Reduxstagram

This is an upgraded version of Wes Bos's Reduxstagram application which he used for the (Learning Redux](https://github.com/wesbos/Learn-Redux) training videos. It uses react-router-dom v4, instead of v2.4. It uses scss instead of stylus. Webpack 4 instead of v1.13. 

A running version of the site can be viewed at [https://chrispauley.github.io/reduxstagram/](https://chrispauley.github.io/reduxstagram/)

### Other Changes
Needed to use HashRouter in order to work with gh-pages.
